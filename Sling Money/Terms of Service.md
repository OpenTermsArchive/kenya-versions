#### Our Products 

###### We have created a mobile app to let you send digital cash, super fast. We are doing it with blockchain infrastructure, in a way that will be accessible and useful to more people, throughout the world.

###### We provide a global payment application, via websites (each, a “**Site**”) and downloadable applications (each, an “App”), designed to help Users store, pay, transfer, and exchange stablecoin and fiat currencies.  

The Sling App uses Solana blockchain technology and stablecoins, such as USDC, USDP to allow Users to exchange and transfer stablecoins to other Users. 

* Sling App helps a User create their own secure self-custody wallet. Sling Money is not a custodian.
    
* Sling App processes the exchange of supported fiat for supported stablecoins. 
    
* Sling facilitates the transfer, in supported stablecoins to another wallet for either a User or non-User of the Service or external (non-Sling) wallets on the Solana Blockchain.
    
* Users maintain control of their wallets and stablecoins for transactions processed through Sling, as they own and possess the funds in their Sling App wallet.     
    

A Sling Link is a tool for transferring stablecoins to people who are not yet Sling Money Users.

#### Account Registration

###### This Section describes some of the basics for your Sling Money Account. You will need to follow our ID authentication procedures before you can access the full functionality of your Accounts and Sling Money Wallet.  You are responsible for your account and all activities under your Account. If you believe your Account is not secure, contact us at [\[email protected\]](https://sling.money/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)

**General.**

**Upon registration.** You will be required to provide your name, date of birth, email address, phone number, and location. This information will allow you to access the app in a restricted mode where full functionality is disabled until identity verification is successfully completed. Access to features such as sending or receiving money, adding payment methods, or linking wallets will remain unavailable until verification is approved.

To access most features of the Service, you must register and complete identity verification for an account (an “Account”). When you register for an Account, you will be required to provide us with some information about yourself, such as your name, email address, or other contact information. You agree that the information you provide to us is accurate, complete, and not misleading, and that you will keep it accurate and up to date at all times. Each User may register only one Account.

Users who fail to complete identity verification may lose access to any data or functionality associated with their restricted account after three (3) years.

**Third party Access**. When you register, you will be asked to login with a third-party service such as Google or Sign In With Apple or asked to create a password. You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your Account and login mechanism, and you accept responsibility for all activities that occur under your Account. If you believe that your Account is no longer secure, then you must immediately notify us.  

**Identity Verification**. Users must complete the identity verification process to access full services. Restricted access, which includes downloading the app and viewing limited features, is available upon submission of basic personal information. It does not require identity verfication.

The restricted mode is designed to enable users to explore the platform while ensuring compliance with legal and regulatory obligations. Failure to verify identity within three (3) years may result in account suspension or deletion of provided data.

When agreeing to complete verification, you hereby authorize us, directly or through the use of third parties, to make any inquiries we consider necessary to validate your identity or authenticate your identity and Account information. This may include asking you for further information or documentation about your use of the Service or your identity, requiring you to take steps to confirm ownership of your email address, phone number, or financial instruments, or verifying your information against third party databases or through other sources. You agree to provide us with the information we request (which we may request at any time we deem necessary) for the purposes of identity verification and the detection of money laundering, terrorist financing, fraud, or any other financial crime. If you decline to provide us with the information that we request or if we cannot verify your identity, then you will not be able to use some or all of the Service, which may include, without limitation, the ability to make, receive, or transfer payments or transactions beyond certain volume limits. In some cases, you may be able to receive payments into your Account at Sling Money or otherwise transfer via the Service (more on that below), but you may not be able to transfer it to any account outside of the Service. We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your Account or access to the Service if you provide any inaccurate, false, or incomplete information.

**Responsibility.**  You agree that we are able to treat any and all instructions or requests provided via your Account as genuine, authentic and correct and we will not carry out any verification of any such instructions to ensure they come from or are authorised by you, or that they are correct.  You agree that we are not responsible for any losses you might suffer as a result of us acting on any instructions or requests provided via your Account and accordingly you are responsible for ensuring that your Account is kept secure. You are responsible for ensuring the validity of the recipient of your transfer, to avoid any instructions or requests being placed that could cause you loss.

**Contact Information.** You are responsible for keeping your contact details such as your email address and phone number up to date. This will help you receive any notices or alerts that we may send to you and help people find you quickly in the Sling Directory, if you choose to allow that access. 

**Sling Directory.** When you sign up for Sling Money you have the option of being listed in the Sling Directory. Users who are listed in the Directory can be found through our search function in-App.

###   
Sling Money App Service

###### This Section describes how Users can set up their own wallet and send and receive payments in our supported currency types.

###### Users own and possess the funds in their wallets, and you are solely responsible for your Account activity.

###### We outline how Users can on and off ramp fiat easily.

###### Users should note that prices of stablecoins and Fiat Currency fluctuate. Avian Labs is not liable to you for losses caused by fluctuations.

###### Avian Labs is not a party to any transaction between Users on the blockchain, as Users maintain control and ownership of their wallets.

**On Ramp.** Once you have opened an Account, you can link your nominated bank account, debit card, PIX or mobile money wallet to fund the Account and process a transaction with available funds. Your Account will not be eligible to on ramp, send, receive or off ramp funds until you have given us certain information and we have verified your identity.

**Link your Bank account.** Depending on the country in which you are based, we may be able to utilize the Open Banking system to connect to your bank and financial data through an application programming interface (API). For Users based in the United States, this may be completed through the Automated Clearing House (ACH) process.

**Link your Debit Card.** If you pay any fees with a debit card, then Avian Labs may seek pre-authorization of your debit card account prior to your purchase to verify that the debit card is valid and has the necessary funds to cover your purchase. You may elect to have any funds transferred to you through the Service to be transferred immediately to your bank account through your debit card (a “Push Payment”).

**Link your Mobile Money Wallet**: Depending on the country in which you are based, you may link your mobile money wallet to your Account to facilitate transactions. This option allows you to fund your Sling MoneyAccount and process transaction directly from your mobile wallet.

**Link your PIX**: Depending on the country in which you are based, you may link your PIX information to your Account to facilitate transactions. This option allows you to fund your Account and process transactions directly from your PIX linked account.

**Stablecoin Services.** Our product is powered, in part, by users transacting in stablecoins. Our platform leverages the use of stablecoins such as USD Coin (USDC), EURO Coin (EUROC)  issued by Circle Internet Financial, LLC and Pax Dollar (USDP), issued by Paxos Trust Company, LLC.

Specifically **for residents of the United States**: by using our product, you will buy and sell stablecoins with [Paxos Trust Company](https://paxos.com/), a New York State chartered trust company. By agreeing to these terms you agree to be bound by Paxos' terms and conditions and other user policies post at [https://paxos.com/general-terms-and-conditions/](https://paxos.com/general-terms-and-conditions/), which may be modified by Paxos Trust Company from time to time.

You agree, as a condition to using our services and transacting with Paxos, to provide us accurate and complete information about yourself and you authorize us to share such information and transaction data related to your use of the services ( inclusive of purchases and sales of stablecoins) with Paxos Trust Company or other relevant third parties.

**Sling Money App Primary Wallet.** Eligible Users can use the Service with a self-custody Solana wallet to store (i) stablecoin which is a digital representation of value based on a cryptographic protocol of a computer network (“**virtual currency**”) and (ii) fiat currency (“**Fiat Currency**”). Virtual currency and Fiat Currency that are available for Users to buy, sell, and hold using the Sling Money App are referred to in these Terms as “**Supported Currencies**”. The Fiat Currency value we display for any type of Supported Currency is an estimate based on market data available to us and is not a guaranteed exchange rate.

**Supported Currencies**. The Sling Money App is intended solely for proper use of Supported Currencies as designated on the Service. We assume no responsibility in connection with any attempt to use the Sling Money App with virtual currency or Fiat Currency that we do not support. Virtual currencies such as USDC, USDP/PAX Dollar, EUROE  and EUROC are virtual currencies pegged to an external reference value such as the U.S. dollar or Euro,  referred to as stablecoins. Please refer to the Sling App to see the full list of acceptable and Supported Currencies.

**Third-party wallet transfers.** You may transfer supported stablecoins to and from third party wallets that are on the Solana Blockchain. Transfers sent in error with unsupported blockchains or stablecoins may results in lost funds. Sling Money is on the Solana blockchain and supports USDP and USDC stablecoins only. All stablecoin transfers in and out of Sling Money are performed using disposable "**Transfer Wallets**", which are created specifically for the purpose of facilitating third party wallet transfers. Transfer Wallets are self-custodial with the option to export your key(s), like your Primary Wallet. All external wallet stablecoin transfers are performed through the Transfer Wallet which facilitate the analysis of transfers to ensure they are in compliance with Sling's regulatory and legal obligations and risk appetite.

**Ownership and Control**. You own and control all Supported Currencies held in your Sling Money App wallet. As the owner of the Supported Currencies in your Sling Money App wallet, you bear all risk of loss of such Supported Currencies. We help you create a wallet as part of the Sling App registration process. We act as the counterparty for the process of selling and buying stablecoin to fund your transfer. To the extent permitted by the applicable law, Avian Labs will have no liability for Supported Currency fluctuations or loss associated with your use of the Sling App. Subject to outages, downtime, and other applicable policies, you may withdraw your Supported Currencies at any time by sending it to a different blockchain address. You are solely in control of and responsible for your Sling App wallet, and accordingly only you can authorize transactions from your Sling App wallet. **You expressly acknowledge and agree that the Services provided through the Sling Money is a self-custody wallet and that you are solely responsible for your activity and any risk of loss at all times. Transactions completed on the blockchain are final.**

**Private Key Generation & Storage**. Self-custody wallets work by generating and storing “private keys” that allow you to securely store your stablecoin. Each private key corresponds to a public key. A public key is also referred to as a wallet address. The public and private keys are used together to transact on the blockchain. This public-private key pair is unique. As part of the Service, during the Account registration process,  we work with a third-party service that supports the encryption and back up of the private key, simply and securely. This is completed using certain key components, such as your Account login information, biometric information, and recovery instruction (e.g. set of security questions or email back up). All components used to generate keys are personal to you and you only. The private key is stored on the Users device. The User always maintains control of the ownership and access to their keys.

**Retrieve & Exporting Keys**. A User retrieves their Private Key through the Sling Money App. You will be required to connect to the device you used when registering with Sling, with your biometric information to access your App. You can then download the private key information and transfer to another wallet of your choice at any time.

**Account Balance.** Any balance in your Account represents your ownership of the amount of each type of Supported Currency shown. When you view your Account balance, we will show you the amount of each type of virtual asset you hold, as well as the fiat currency equivalent value that you have selected.

**Purchasing Stablecoin.** You may use the Service to buy virtual currencies such as stablecoin (e.g., USDC) using the following funding sources:

1. a bank account in your name linked to your Account;
    
2. a debit card in your name linked to your Account;
    
3. a mobile money wallet in your name linked to your Account;
    
4. a account linked to PIX with your details;
    
5. Stablecoin currently held in your Wallet
    

You must have enough available funds in your selected funding source to complete your transaction.

We will show you the amount of stablecoin you would receive in exchange for the amount of Fiat Currency that you wish to spend. Because the price of stablecoin fluctuates, the price we provide will only be valid for a limited time. If the price we provided expires, you will not be able to complete your transaction at that price. In this instance, we will provide you with updated pricing information for the stablecoin. Once you confirm your transaction, we will then execute your purchase. Once confirmed, your purchase of stablecoin is not reversible. You may see your transaction history in your Account. We strongly recommend that you turn on notifications in your device settings and in-App for additional information and updates.

**Prices shown in the App do not include our spread or transaction fees.**

**Transaction Authorization.** When you initiate a payment transfer, you authorize us to debit your Account or linked payment method by the amount you specify, and to send those funds to your designated recipient immediately upon your request. By submitting a payment transfer, you are also authorizing us to move funds to your Account or linked payment method for payments that are cancelled or otherwise returned. You understand and agree that when you initiate a payment transfer, processing will begin, and funds will leave your Account or linked payment method as early as the moment you initiate the payment transfer. **In some cases, transactions and payment may be delayed or blocked until you or the intended recipient provides us with all required information. This can occur for reasons such as ensuring we protect our Users and ourselves from fraud and financial crime. In other cases, recipients may have access to the funds immediately, such as, as soon they receive a Sling Link.**

**Off Ramp - Transferring Funds Out of Your Account.** Supported Currency may be transferred out of your Account through a linked bank account or eligible debit card. You can manage linked payment methods in the Sling Money App account settings. There may be additional fees applicable to the transfers, and we may set limits on your Account or transfers. Please check your App to see fees that may apply to transferring currency out of your Account. Fees and limits may change from time to time in our sole discretion.  
  

**Specifically for residents of the United States:** when you choose to off-ramp to your local bank account, our partner [Beam - Ansible Labs, Inc](https://www.ansiblelabs.xyz/) will provide payment services for this transaction in conjunction with [Cross River Bank](https://www.crossriver.com/). By agreeing to these terms you agree to be bound by Beam's terms and conditions and other user policies posted at [https://beam.ansiblelabs.xyz/terms](https://beam.ansiblelabs.xyz/terms), which may be modified by Beam from time to time.  
  
You agree, as a condition to using our services and transacting with Beam, to provide us accurate and complete information about yourself and you authorise us to share such information and transaction data related to your use of the services with Beam or other third parities.

**In some cases, transactions and payment may be delayed or blocked until you or the intended recipient provides us with all required information. This can occur for reasons such as ensuring we protect our Users and ourselves from fraud and financial crime**.

**Supported Currency Fluctuations.** The price of virtual currency and exchange rates for various Fiat Currencies will rise and fall over time, and the price may sometimes change quickly and dramatically. So, even if the number of one Supported Currency you hold remains the same, the equivalent value in a different Supported Currency (e.g. U.S. dollar value) will change as the market price or exchange rate of each Supported Currency fluctuates. The Fiat Currency value we display for any type of Supported Currency is an estimate based on market data available to us. This estimate does not represent the value you will receive if you actually sell or exchange your Supported Currency or the price you will pay to buy more Supported Currency.

**Currency Fluctuations with Sling Links.** We intend to honor the face value of a Sling Link, when the following criteria is met;

* The currency is in GBP ( British Pound Sterling) or Euro 
    
* Sling Link is claimed in the same currency it was created in.
    

Any fluctuations in the exchange rates will be consumed by Sling, subject to fair usage limits. Sling will monitor the Sling Link activity and reserves the right to make changes to this term for individual Sling Links, or for all Sling Links, at its sole discretion, as it deems appropriate.

**Account Closure.** You may close your Sling Account by transferring all funds out of your wallet, transferring to another of your wallets outside of the Service, and removing the App from your device. The Public Key will remain on the blockchain, due to the nature of the blockchain as a digitally distributed, decentralized, public ledger. It is very important that you download your Private Key information prior to deleting or removing the App.

#### Sling Link

### Sling Link allows Sling Money App Users to send funds to non-Users via a link generated by the Service. Payment transfers made via Sling Link are not reversible or cancellable. You are solely responsible for Sling Link payment transfers initiated through your Account.

The Service allows Users to send payments, including with stablecoin, to non-Users. By generating a Sling Link via the Service, you authorize and direct us to debit your Account or linked payment method (which may be completed immediately) and deliver such funds to the recipient information you select via the Service. Sling Links are designed for immediate withdrawal by recipients of the Sling Link.

Please ensure all recipient information is correct before completing any transactions, including making any payments, via the Service. You are responsible for informing recipients of the ability to access funds via a Sling Link and the importance of keeping Sling Links secure. Although we may perform certain identity verification actions with respect to potential recipients, it is ultimately up to the User who sends a Sling Link transfer to ensure it is being sent to the appropriate individual for the appropriate purpose. These transfers are instant, should a non-intended recipient obtain the Sling Link or address, it can intercept the transfer. We are not responsible for any payments that are received or accessed by an unintended recipient using a Sling Link generated via the Service.

There can be limitations on where Sling Links can be claimed, check in-app for the most up-to-date information.

#### Payment Terms

### You are responsible for transactions made under your Account. You authorize Avian Labs to charge all transactions you make to the payment method specified in your Account. You are also responsible for the applicable fees for your use of the Service. If you are late or fail to make payment, we may take steps such as suspending your Account or charging additional fees.

**Authorization.** You authorize Avian Labs to charge all sums for the transactions that you make and any level of Service you select as described in these Terms or in-App, including all applicable taxes, to the payment method specified in your Account.

**Unpaid Fees.** Avian Labs may suspend or terminate access to the Service for any Account for which any amount is due but unpaid. In addition to the amount due for the Service, you may be charged with additional charges for any chargeback or collection of any of the unpaid amount, including collection fees. Avian Labs reserves the right to delete your Account and any information or User Content (as defined below) associated with your Account without any liability to you.

**Chargebacks.** We are not liable for the goods or services purchased by you with your card or Account. All such disputes must be addressed directly with the individual providing the relevant goods or services. We are not liable for the transfer of funds sent by you with your card or Account to a recipient. All such disputes must be addressed directly with the recipient. Once you have authorized your transfer, we cannot stop or reverse that transaction.

**Invalid Authorization.** If we are required to invalidate a transaction because the card issuer or originating bank declined or reversed the transaction, then you may be liable for the transaction even if you disagree with the decision of the card issuer or originating bank to decline or reverse the payment.

**Unauthorized Transactions.** If you believe that a transaction initiated on your Account was not authorized, then you must notify us immediately by emailing [\[email protected\]](https://sling.money/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection), even if you (or someone else) dispute the transaction with the card issuer or originating bank. If you fail to report the unauthorized activity directly to us, then we may recover the amount of the reversed payment from you.

**Link your Debit Card.** If you pay any fees with a debit card, then Avian Labs may seek pre-authorization of your debit card account prior to your purchase to verify that the debit card is valid and has the necessary funds to cover your purchase. You may elect to have any funds transferred to you through the Service to be transferred immediately to your bank account through your debit card (a “Push Payment”), if that is supported by your banking provider.

**Link your Mobile Money Wallet:** There may be fees applied by your Mobile Money Wallet Provider to add or withdraw funds to your Sling Money Wallet.

### You should only send payment transfers to individuals you know and trust. We may review transactions at our discretion and may take additional actions depending on our review.

**Generally.** The Service should only be used to transact with people you know and trust. We do not recommend using the Service to transact with people you don’t know, including by sending someone a Sling Link, especially if the payment involves the purchase or sale of a good or service. If you use the Service to conduct such a transaction and we later reverse the payment (which could occur if it is determined that these Terms were violated or if the payment was made using a compromised payment method or account), you could lose the funds sent. The Service does not provide you deposit or investment account protection.

**Transaction Review.** We review transactions you make at our discretion. When we identify a potentially high-risk transaction or activity, such as fraud or financial crime, we may review it more closely. When this happens, we may place a hold on the transaction and notify the other party. If we clear the transaction, we may also notify the other party. If we don’t clear the transaction, we will decline or cancel it and return the money to you, unless we are legally required to take other action.

EXCEPT AS PROVIDED IN SECTIONS - COMMENCING ARBITRATION) AND (i) - ARBITRATION RELIEF AND TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF THE AVIAN LABS ENTITIES TO YOU FOR ALL CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE USE OF OR ANY INABILITY TO USE ANY PORTION OF THE SERVICE OR OTHERWISE UNDER THESE TERMS, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE, IS LIMITED TO THE GREATER OF: (a) THE AMOUNT YOU HAVE PAID TO AVIAN LABS FOR ACCESS TO THE SERVICE (E.G.

EACH PROVISION OF THESE TERMS THAT PROVIDES FOR A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY, DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES, OR EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES IS INTENDED TO AND DOES ALLOCATE THE RISKS BETWEEN THE PARTIES UNDER THESE TERMS.

### Complaints, Dispute Resolution and Arbitration

#### For any disputes or issues, Avian Labs encourages initial contact through their app or email, with a structured complaint process in place that includes acknowledging, impartially reviewing, and responding within 15 business days with either a resolution, rejection, or alternative solution

**Complaints.** In the event of any dispute or problem please contact us in-App or via email in the first instance. In the event that your query is not satisfactorily resolved, you may lodge a complaint with us or request details about our complaint handling procedures.

When raising an official complaint, please set out the reason for your complaint, how you would like us to resolve the complaint and any other information you believe to be relevant. We will acknowledge receipt of your complaint. A member of our team will consider your complaint without prejudice based on the information you have provided and information held by us.

Within 15 business days of our receipt of your complaint we will address all points raised in your complaint by sending you an email explaining how we will  (i) resolve your complaint in the way you requested; (ii) make a determination rejecting your complaint and set out the reasons for the rejection; or (iii) offer to resolve your complaint with an alternative solution. 

The following sections relates specifically **to residents of the United States;**

**Notice to California Residents.** If you are a California resident, then under California Civil Code Section 1789.3, you may contact the Complaint Assistance Unit of the Division of Consumer Services of the California Department of Consumer Affairs in writing at 1625 N. Market Blvd., Suite S-202, Sacramento, California 95834, or by telephone at +1-800-952-5210 in order to resolve a complaint regarding the Service or to receive further information regarding use of the Service.

**Dispute.** Except as described in Section - Exceptions and Opt-Out, you and Avian Labs agree that every dispute arising in connection with these Terms, the Service, or communications from us will be resolved through binding arbitration. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, is less formal than a court proceeding, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by courts. This agreement to arbitrate disputes includes all claims whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether a claim arises during or after the termination of these Terms. Any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of this binding arbitration agreement will be resolved by the arbitrator.

**Exceptions.** Although we are agreeing to arbitrate most disputes between us, nothing in these Terms will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit the right of either party to: (i) bring an individual action in small claims court; (ii) pursue an enforcement action through the applicable federal, state, or local agency if that action is available; (iii) seek injunctive relief in a court of law in aid of arbitration; or (iv) to file suit in a court of law to address an intellectual property infringement claim.

**Opt-Out.** If you do not wish to resolve disputes by binding arbitration, you may opt out of the provisions of this Section-Dispute Resolution and Arbitration within 30 days after the date that you agree to these Terms by sending a letter to Avian Labs, Inc., Attention: Legal Department – Arbitration Opt-Out, 8 The Green, Suite #12690, Dover, DE 19901 that specifies: your full legal name, the email address associated with your Account on the Service, and a statement that you wish to opt out of arbitration (“**Opt-Out Notice**”). Once Avian Labs receives your Opt-Out Notice, this Section-Dispute Resolution and Arbitration  will be void and any action arising out of these Terms will be resolved as set forth in Section - Governing Law. The remaining provisions of these Terms will not be affected by your Opt-Out Notice.

**Arbitrator.** This arbitration agreement, and any arbitration between us, is subject the Federal Arbitration Act and will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) under its Consumer Arbitration Rules (collectively, “AAA Rules”) as modified by these Terms. The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at +1-800-778-7879, or by contacting Avian Labs. 

**Commencing Arbitration.** Before initiating arbitration, a party must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other party by certified U.S. Mail or by Federal Express (signature required) or, only if that other party has not provided a current physical address, then by electronic mail (“**Notice of Arbitration**”). Avian Labs’s address for Notice is: Avian Labs, Inc., 8 The Green, Suite #12690, Dover, DE 19901. The Notice of Arbitration must: (a) identify the name or account number of the party making the claim; (b) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (c) set forth the specific relief sought (“**Demand**”). The parties will make good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if the parties do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice of Arbitration is received, you or Avian Labs may commence an arbitration proceeding. If you commence arbitration in accordance with these Terms, Avian Labs will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for more than US$10,000 or if Avian Labs has received 25 or more similar demands for arbitration, in which case the payment of any fees will be decided by the AAA Rules. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of the claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules and the other party may seek reimbursement for any fees paid to AAA.

**Arbitration Proceedings.** Any arbitration hearing will take place in the county and state of your billing address unless we agree otherwise or, if the claim is for US$10,000 or less (and does not seek injunctive relief), you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted: (a) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (b) through a telephonic or video hearing; or (c) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Avian Labs must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. 

**Arbitration Relief.** Except as provided in Section —No Class Actions, the arbitrator can award any relief that would be available if the claims had been brought in a court of competent jurisdiction. If the arbitrator awards you an amount higher than the last written settlement amount offered by Avian before an arbitrator was selected, Avian Labs will pay to you the higher of: (a) the amount awarded by the arbitrator and (b) US$10,000. The arbitrator’s award shall be final and binding on all parties, except (1) for judicial review expressly permitted by law or (2) if the arbitrator's award includes an award of injunctive relief against a party, in which case that party shall have the right to seek judicial review of the injunctive relief in a court of competent jurisdiction that shall not be bound by the arbitrator's application or conclusions of law. Judgement on the award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.

**No Class Actions.** YOU AND AVIAN LABS AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and Avian Labs agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.  

**Modifications to this Arbitration Provision.** If Avian Labs makes any substantive change to this arbitration provision, you may reject the change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to Avian Labs’s address for Notice of Arbitration, in which case your Account with Avian Labs will be immediately terminated and this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the changes you rejected will survive.

**Enforceability.** If Section - No Class Actions or the entirety of this Section - Dispute Resolution and Arbitration is found to be unenforceable, or if Avian Labs receives an Opt-Out Notice from you, then the entirety of this Section-Dispute Resolution and Arbitration will be null and void and, in that case, the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section- Governing Law will govern any action arising out of or related to these Terms.

### Intellectual Property Rights Protection

#### This Section sets forth the procedure for protecting intellectual property rights in content posted to the Service. If you believe a User has posted content that violates your intellectual property rights, please notify us as described in this Section. If you receive notice that your User Content violates a third party’s intellectual property rights, and you disagree, you can dispute the claim as described in this Section.

**Respect of Third Party Rights.** Avian Labs respects the intellectual property rights of others, takes the protection of intellectual property rights very seriously, and asks Users of the Service to do the same. Infringing activity will not be tolerated on or through the Service.

**DMCA Notification.** If you are a **resident of the US,** we comply with the provisions of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act applicable to Internet service providers (17 U.S.C. § 512, as amended). If you have an intellectual property rights-related complaint about any material on the Service, you may contact our Designated Agent at the following address:

Avian Labs, Inc.  
Attn: Legal Department (IP Notification)  
8 The Green, Suite #12690  
Dover, DE 19901  
Email: [\[email protected\]](https://sling.money/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)

**Procedure for Reporting Claimed Infringement.** If you believe that any content made available on or through the Service has been used or exploited in a manner that infringes an intellectual property right you own or control, then please promptly send a written “Notification of Claimed Infringement” to the Designated Agent identified above containing the following information:

1. an electronic or physical signature of the person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright or other right being infringed;
    
2. a description of the copyrighted work or other intellectual property right that you claim has been infringed;
    
3. a description of the material that you claim is infringing and where it is located on the Service;
    
4. your address, phone number, and email address;
    
5. a statement by you that you have a good faith belief that the use of the materials on the Service of which you are complaining is not authorized by the copyright or other intellectual property right owner, its agent, or the law; and
    
6. a statement by you that the above information in your notice is accurate and that, under penalty of perjury, you are the copyright or other intellectual property right owner or authorized to act on the copyright or intellectual property owner’s behalf.
    

Your Notification of Claimed Infringement may be shared by Avian Labs with the User alleged to have infringed a right you own or control as well as with the operators of publicly available databases that track notifications of claimed infringement, and you consent to Avian Labs making such disclosures. You should consult with your own lawyer or see 17 U.S.C. § 512 to confirm your obligations to provide a valid notice of claimed infringement.

**Repeat Infringers.** Avian Labs’s policy is to: (a) remove or disable access to material that Avian Labs believes in good faith, upon notice from an intellectual property rights owner or authorized agent, is infringing the intellectual property rights of a third party by being made available through the Service; and (b) in appropriate circumstances, to terminate the Accounts of and block access to the Service by any User who repeatedly or egregiously infringes other people’s copyright or other intellectual property rights. Avian Labs will terminate the Accounts of Users that are determined by Avian Labs to be repeat infringers. Avian Labs reserves the right, however, to suspend or terminate Accounts of Users in our sole discretion.

**Counter Notification.** If you receive a notification from Avian Labs that material made available by you on or through the Service has been the subject of a Notification of Claimed Infringement, then you will have the right to provide Avian Labs with what is called a “**Counter Notification.**” To be effective, a Counter Notification must be in writing, provided to Avian Labs’s Designated Agent through one of the methods identified in Section -DMCA Notification, and include substantially the following information:

1. your physical or electronic signature;
    
2. identification of the material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or access to it was disabled;
    
3. a statement under penalty of perjury that you have a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled; and
    
4. your name, address, and telephone number, and a statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial district in which the address is located, or if you are residing outside of the United States, then for any judicial district in which Avian Labs may be found, and that you will accept service of process from the person who provided notification under Section-DMCA Notification above or an agent of that person.
    

A party submitting a Counter Notification should consult a lawyer or see 17 U.S.C. § 512 to confirm the party’s obligations to provide a valid counter notification under the Copyright Act.

**Reposting of Content Subject to a Counter Notification.** If you submit a Counter Notification to Avian Labs in response to a Notification of Claimed Infringement, then Avian Labs will promptly provide the person who provided the Notification of Claimed Infringement with a copy of your Counter Notification and inform that person that Avian Labs will replace the removed User Content or cease disabling access to it in 10 business days, and Avian Labs will replace the removed User Content and cease disabling access to it not less than 10, nor more than 14, business days following receipt of the Counter Notification, unless Avian Labs’s Designated Agent receives notice from the party that submitted the Notification of Claimed Infringement that such person has filed an action seeking a court order to restrain the User from engaging in infringing activity relating to the material on Avian Labs’s system or network.

**False Notifications of Claimed Infringement or Counter Notifications.** The Copyright Act provides at 17 U.S.C. § 512(f) that: “\[a\]ny person who knowingly materially misrepresents under \[Section 512 of the Copyright Act (17 U.S.C. § 512)\] (1) that material or activity is infringing, or (2) that material or activity was removed or disabled by mistake or misidentification, will be liable for any damages, including costs and attorneys’ fees, incurred by the alleged infringer, by any copyright owner or copyright owner’s authorized licensee, or by a service provider, who is injured by such misrepresentation, as the result of \[Avian Labs\] relying upon such misrepresentation in removing or disabling access to the material or activity claimed to be infringing, or in replacing the removed material or ceasing to disable access to it.” Avian Labs reserves the right to seek damages from any party that submits a Notification of Claimed Infringement or Counter Notification in violation of the law.

  

### Cryptocurrency Protocols

#### Avian Labs is not responsible for the operation of the protocols underlying any Cryptocurrency.

Avian Labs does not own or control the underlying software protocols which govern the operation of Cryptocurrency. Generally, the underlying protocols are open source, and anyone can use, copy, modify, and distribute them. We assume no responsibility for the operation of the underlying protocols and do not guarantee the functionality or security of network operations.

Avian Labs does not control the timing and features of these operating changes. It is your responsibility to make yourself aware of upcoming operating changes and you must carefully consider publicly available information in determining whether to continue to use the Service for the affected Cryptocurrency. In the event of any such operational change, Avian Labs reserves the right to take such steps as may be necessary to protect the security and safety of assets held on the Service, including without limitation, temporarily suspending operations for the involved Cryptocurrency. Avian Labs’s response to any operating change is subject to its sole discretion and may include deciding not to support any new Cryptocurrency, fork, or other actions. **You acknowledge and accept the risks of operating changes to Cryptocurrency protocols and agree that Avian Labs is not responsible for such operating changes and not liable for any loss of value you may experience as a result of such changes in operating rules.
