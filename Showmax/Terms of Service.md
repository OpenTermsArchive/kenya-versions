----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

9.1 Each Subscriber may create up to six (6) profiles in his or her Showmax Account. The Subscriber can create kids profiles or regular profiles, set an age restriction in the settings of each profile (“**Age Restriction**”), and manage access rights of Authorised Users to individual profiles. For kids profiles, the Subscriber can set one of the following Age Restrictions: Little Kids (A), Older Kids (7-9 PG) or Pre-Teen (10-12 PG). For regular profiles, the Subscriber can set one of the following Age Restrictions: Family (PG), Teen (13+ and 16+) or Adults (18+). The Subscriber is required to confirm his or her password to set or adjust the Age Restriction of each profile. The main profile cannot be a kids profile.

9.2 When an Age Restriction is set for a profile, video playback is restricted for the Content that is rated above the profile’s Age Restriction. To prevent a minor from switching to a profile with a higher Age Restriction to bypass the playback restriction, the Subscriber may also set a 4-digit PIN for each profile (the “**Profile PIN**”).

Setting and/or changing the Profile PIN also requires the Subscriber’s password.

We will attempt to provide appropriate audience guidelines relating to the Content.

The subscription period for each Subscription Plan is one month from the day of the of the purchase of the subscription (the “**Subscription Period**”) (e.g., if you registered on 15 March, the first Subscription Period will continue until 15 April, and the next Subscription Period will continue until 15 May and so forth). However, if the Subscriber was given the Free Trial, the Subscription Period will be calculated from the day after the Free Trial expires and continue until the corresponding day in the following month (notwithstanding that your subscription started at the beginning of the Free Trial period). 

10.2 The Subscriber can choose between Subscription Plans with monthly or once-off payment. 

10.3 If the Subscriber chooses a Subscription Plan with monthly payment, the Subscription Period will automatically renew on the Monthly Billing Date, as defined below.

10.5 Free Trial terms and conditions 

10.5.1 We may sometimes allow the Subscriber to use the Showmax Service within a period of 14 days after the Subscriber registers (or such other period we may specify upon registration) and we will not charge the Subscriber for use of the Showmax Service during this time (“**Free Trial**“). The Free Trial requires that the Subscriber choose a payment method and provide the necessary payment information. If we give a Subscriber a Free Trial and the Subscriber does not cancel the subscription before the end of the Free Trial period, the Subscriber will be required to pay the Monthly Fee and the subscription will continue as a subscription with monthly payment until we or the Subscriber end this Agreement in the way set out in clause 14. 

10.5.2 Free Trials are strictly reserved for first-time Subscribers. You will not qualify for a Free Trial if your payment details have been used to pay for a subscription on another Showmax Account or if you have registered before. 

10.5.3 We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to determine whether you are entitled to a Free Trial. 

10.5.4 If you cancel the subscription before the end of the Free Trial, you will continue to have access to the Showmax Service for the remainder of the Free Trial period.

However, if the Subscriber was given the Free Trial, the Monthly Billing Date will be calculated from the day after the Free Trial expires (e.g., if the Free Trial ended on 15 March, the first Monthly Billing Date will be 16 March and the 16th day of each month after that). 

11.1.5 The Subscriber must pay the Monthly Fee on each Monthly Billing Date. If you choose a Subscription plan with monthly payment, the Monthly Fee will be automatically deducted from your funds using the Payment Method that you chose. 

11.1.6 If you wish to change your Subscription Plan, you must cancel your current Subscription Plan and purchase a new one.

11.3 **Payment Method** 

11.3.1 In order to complete the registration process, you will be required to tell us which method you will use to make a payment (e.g., with a credit card, a debit card, using a voucher, through a partner (add-to-bill) or another payment facility made available on the Showmax Website or the Showmax App), (your “**Payment Method**“) and give us the details of your Payment Method that are necessary to carry out the payment, (your “**Payment Details**“). 

11.3.2 By registering for the Showmax Service and providing your designated Payment Method or Payment Details, you authorise us to charge you the Monthly Fee at the then current rate, and any other charges you may incur through the use of the Showmax Service to your Payment Details and Payment Method.
