SCHEDULE A - TRADING CONTRACTS FOR DIFFERENCE



This Schedule A sets out the additional terms that will apply to you when you trade CFDs with us. Capitalised termsused in this Schedule A have the meanings ascribed to them in Clause 89 unless such capitalised term is definedwithin this Schedule A context requires otherwise. If a provision of this Schedule A conflicts with or differs from aprovision in another part of these Terms, the provision in this Schedule A will prevail to the extent necessary.

1. What is CFD trading?



1.1 CFD trading is a type of transaction which may be used to secure a profit or avoid a loss by reference tofluctuations in the value or price of an underlying instrument. Types of CFDs include but are not limitedto, foreign exchange CFDs, futures CFDs, option CFDs, share CFDs, stock index CFDs, and cryptoassetCFDs. The CFDs that we offer will be indicated on our Website from time to time.

1.2 CFDs can only be settled in cash.

2. The key risks of CFD trading



2.1 CFDs are complex derivative products. CFDs can come with a high risk of losing money quickly due tothe use of leverage. Trading with leverage magnifies your gains and losses, so small price changes inthe underlying instrument can result in large losses or gains. It is therefore possible that you may losemore than your deposits.

2.2 If you trade in CFDs you may sustain a loss exceeding the margin you deposit to establish or maintain aPosition. If the market moves against you, additional Equity may be required at short notice to maintainthe Margin required to keep a Position open. If you fail to do so, your Position may be liquidated and youwill be responsible for the resulting deficit. Even if a transaction is not margined, it may still carry anobligation to make further payments in certain circumstances over and above any amount paid when youentered into the contract.

2.3 You must fully understand the risks involved before using our Services and trading CFDs. Youmust take appropriate investment, financial, legal, tax and other necessary professional,independent advice where required. More information on the risks associated with trading CFDsis set out in our Risk Warning Notice (as amended from time to time) which is available on ourWebsite. You should read this document and fully understand the risks before entering into theseTerms.



3. Product pricing



3.1 The prices that we quote to you would be based on the pricing from our Liquidity Providers subject to ourOrder execution policy. You agree that the prices we quote to you will include a spread between the selland the buy price of a Product. The spread may not be an exact amount because it may change betweenthe time you make an Order and the time we execute your Order. The spread may change due to marketconditions. It is your responsibility to decide whether or not you wish to deal at the price quoted by us,save for where we exercise any of our rights to close out a Position or the Position closes automaticallyunder these Terms.

3.2 You will find the pricing details of our Products on our Website or through such other method that wedeem appropriate at our sole discretion.

4. Charges and fees



4.1 We will charge you a fee for each Order, and such fee may be quoted as part of the spread of a Product.

4.3 We may also charge other fees and costs for our Services and Products, including CFDs. Please referto our Website, or contact us, for the latest charges, fees and costs for our Services and Products, whichwe may update from time to time.

5.2 Please refer to our Conflicts of Interest Policy where we set out potential conflicts of interest that mayarise as a result of using our Services.

6. Leverage and Margin



6.1 We allow you to trade CFDs on a non-leveraged basis by opening Fully-Paid Positions. We may alsoallow you to trade CFDs using leverage, please see Section 6 of the Terms.

6.2 Different leverage limits apply to CFDs with different underlying instruments or products. The maximumleverage limit at a particular point in time, for a particular Product, are set out on our Website.

6.3 You can only open a leveraged Position in relation to a CFD if the Margin posted to maintain the openPosition is in the form of money. Collateral cannot be posted as Margin to maintain open Positions onCFDs.

7. Rights in the underlying instrument



7.1 When you trade a CFD, you will have an economic exposure to the underlying security or instrument ofthe CFD, but you will not have legal ownership of any underlying products. For example, if you trade aCFD over shares, you will not have the legal rights attached to such shares, such as voting rights or rightsto dividends. However, we may carry out adjustments if a Corporate Event occurs in accordance withClause 68.

7.2 You acknowledge and agree that we will not transfer to you voting rights relating to a security or anyother instrument underlying the CFD to which you have an open Position, or otherwise allow you toinfluence the exercise of voting rights held by us or by an agent on our behalf.

7.3 Subject to paragraph 7.4 of this Schedule, where the security or instrument underlying your CFD haspaid dividends, a dividend adjustment will be calculated for your Account in respect of open Positionsheld on the ex-dividend date for the relevant underlying security or instrument. Cash adjustmentsreflecting dividends will be credited to your Account if you bought (i.e. opened a long Position), anddebited from your Account if you sold (i.e. opened a short Position). You are reminded that any dividendadjustment may create tax liabilities for you and we may deduct tax when making adjustments inaccordance with Clause 68.2.

7.4 For certain CFD Products with expiry dates, our quote (which is based on the Underlying Market) willinclude a forecasted dividend component. Dividends adjustment in accordance with paragraph 7.3 wouldnot apply to these Products.

8. CFDs on crypto assets



8.1 We may offer CFD Products that have exposure to the value or price of an underlying Crypto Asset("Crypto CFDs"). Crypto Assets are volatile virtual products and come with a high risk of losing moneyquickly. Prices can and do fluctuate significantly on any given day. Due to these price fluctuations, yourCFDs with exposure to Crypto Assets may significantly increase or decrease in value at any givenmoment, and this may result in a loss of all the capital you have invested in a Position. Trading CryptoCFDs pose additional risks which are detailed below.

8.2 We base the prices of our Crypto CFDs from real crypto asset exchanges and trading venues. Our pricesare often aggregated which means that we take our prices from multiple exchanges and trading venuesin order to give you the best from each. These prices may need to be normalised to allow us to aggregate

37



them fairly for all exchanges and trading venues. As such, the prices on our Crypto CFDs may not beexactly the same as the prices you see on the exchanges and trading venues that we use. There maybe instances where we are unable to quote prices for some or all Crypto CFDs.

8.3 The key risks when trading Crypto Asset CFDs include the following:

(a) Crypto Assets are a unique kind of product, backed by technology and trust, unlike mostcurrencies, which are backed by governments or other legal entities, or by commodities suchas gold or silver. This means there is no central bank that can take corrective measure toprotect the value of Crypto Assets in a crisis or issue more currency;

(b) the prices of Crypto Assets can be extremely volatile and can fluctuate significantly in veryshort timeframes. From time to time, Equiti may have periods during which it is closed fortrading. If you hold an open Position on a Crypto CFD in this time, you would not be able totrade and not be able to close any open Position until Equiti reopens trading. This means youwould not be able to close out the Position during this time even if there is significant adverseprice movement. We call this ‘gap risk’;

(c) Crypto Assets are virtual products and they may become 'delisted' or unsupported at any time,which means they may no longer be offered for sale or exchange on markets. If this happens,the Crypto Assets may become worthless. For some Crypto CFDs where the price is takenfrom a single exchange or trading venue, if the exchange or trading venue delists theunderlying Crypto Asset then we would remove the Crypto CFD from our Product offeringand close any affected Positions. We will endeavour to give you as much notice as possible,however, there may be instances where the notice is minimal, if any;

(d) Crypto Assets are often traded using independent blockchain technology and other third partynetworks which are subject to changes and amendments to their systems and to anyApplicable Regulations which may apply to them; and

(e) Crypto Assets are operated by underlying software protocols. The underlying protocols aresubject to sudden changes in operating rules which may result in 'forks':

i. a 'hard' fork is when a Crypto Assets’ underlying code changes and both the new andold blockchains exist side by side. Generally, this means a Crypto Asset splits into two.We may offer Crypto CFDs on both of the new Crypto Assets created due to the forkand we will endeavour to take the same or very similar action as the exchanges whenreflecting the split on your Account. If we are unable to offer one or both of the newCrypto Assets as Crypto CFDs then we may, at our discretion, make a cash adjustmentto represent the value of the new Crypto Asset at a price determined by us; and

ii. a 'soft' fork is when a Crypto Asset’s underlying code changes and all users adopt thenew code or, nodes of newer blockchain that can still communicate with nodes of theolder version. This is often used to implement new features. These changes may affectthe value of the Crypto Asset (and corresponding Crypto CFD) and are reflected simplyas an undated price of the CFD. We may, at our sole discretion, book a cashadjustment of a value, determined by us.



You must carefully consider whether trading Crypto Asset CFDs is suitable for you, in light ofyour financial circumstances. By opening a Position on a Crypto CFD, you agree andacknowledge that you have sufficient and relevant knowledge about, or experience in, trading involatile markets, you are you are trading with money you can afford to lose, and you have a high-risk tolerance.

SCHEDULE B – COPY TRADING



This Schedule B sets out the additional terms that will apply to you when you use the copy trading functionalitieswhich we offer on our copy trading platform (the CT Platform).

1. What is copy trading?



1.1. Through our CT Platform, we offer copy trading functionalities. These functionalities allow a person, who isa Client (the CT Client), to open a copy trading account (the CTA) in order to copy or mirror the tradingactivity of another person, who is also Client, and has registered as a leader (the Leader) and opened aleader account (the LA), on the CT Platform. For the avoidance of doubt, the CT Platform is considered anElectronic Trading Service as defined in the Terms.

1.2. A CT Client who wishes to copy a Leader’s trades may choose to subscribe to a trading strategy offer (an

Offer) listed on a Leader account (the LA) via, and based on the information on the Leader as displayedon, the CT Platform. Such information may include the Leader’s nickname, user picture, account information,trading history, risk profile, Performance Fees, and other information (the Leader Information). It isimportant to note that a Leader has the ability to create multiple Offers listed on the LA, and whilst the tradingstrategy for such multiple Offers will be identical, the Performance Fee set for each Offer may vary. A CTClient may trough their CTA subscribe to one or more Offers listed on one or more Leader’s LA.

1.3. By subscribing to a Leader’s Offer via our CT Platform, a CT Client may select to recreate such Leader'strading instructions, from the time of the CT Client's subscription, either:

(a) without recreating the Leader’s trades that are already open at the time of such subscription;or

(b) with recreating the Leader’s trades that are already open at the time of such subscription,

and, upon making such selection, the CT Client authorises us, without further consultation, consent orapproval, to effect such selected optionality on the CT Client’s CTA.

1.4. If the amount that a CT Client wishes to invest in an Offer is different from the amount the Leader hasinvested in that Offer, the holdings and trading instructions tied to that Offer will be scaled proportionally bydefault on the CT Platform, provided such default settings are not customised by the CT Client in accordancewith paragraph 1.5 below.

1.5. The CT Platform allows the CT Client to customise how a Leader’s trades for a particular Offer are copied,and the CT Client agrees to be bound by the customisations implemented by such CT Client, for thepurposes of using the CT Platform.

1.6. More information about our copy trading functionalities is available on our website or the CT Platform.



2. Regulatory status of copy trading



2.1. Our copy trading functionalities do not constitute a form of discretionary investment management underSeychelles law because CT Clients pre-authorise us to execute trades and we do not exercise discretion inrelation to such trades, nor do the CT Clients pay any performance management fee to us. Subject toApplicable Regulations, we do not assess whether copy trading, copy trading functionalities, or theunderlying instruments traded, are suitable or appropriate for you. It is your responsibility to assess whethercopy trading, copy trading functionalities, or the underlying instruments traded, are suitable or appropriatefor you.

4. The key risks of copy trading



4.1. In choosing to subscribe to one or more Offer, a CT Client should consider their financial situation, financialcommitments and risk tolerance. A CT Client must manage their own risk and should be aware that copytrading carries a high degree of risk, that copy trading may further increase and compound the risk ofunderlying instruments which themselves may be highly speculative, and that they could sustain significantlosses, including as a result of the following:

(a) trades will be opened and closed in a CTA via automated trading execution without theirmanual intervention, which may lead to profits and/or losses;

(b) where and if applicable, if a CT Client manually changes or closes an order created by thecopy trading functionalities, such CT Client may achieve a materially different result than theLeader for that order;

(c) a trade will not be opened (i.e. will be skipped) if the amount is lower than the minimum tradeamount, and in such event a CT Client will not receive any notification. This may occur as aresult of proportional scaling of a Leader's trading instructions. Consequently, the compositionor diversification of a CT Client's trades may differ from those of the Leader;

(d) if a CT Client has chosen to include copying all of a Leader's currently open trades in aparticular Offer, in accordance with paragraph 1.3(b), we will open your position at the bestavailable market price at the time of execution, which may be materially different from theprice paid by the Leader when the trade was originally opened in that particular Offer;

(e) balance withdrawals by a Leader from the LA may result in a materially different result for aCT Client subscribed to a particular Offer listed on the LA of that Leader. This may be due tovarious factors including: starting account balance, trade size (and minimum trade sizes),account settings, differences in spread, slippage, interest and investment price at the time ofinvestment, and fees incurred;

(f) while we have safeguards against bad behaviour by Leaders, we make no representationsas to the accuracy of the Leader Information and/or other client-generated informationdisplayed on our CT Platform and each CT Client should use their judgement when accessingsuch information;

(g) a CT Client is solely responsible for subscribing to an Offer, and you understand that theremay be Leaders who are inexperienced and/or unprofessional;

3



(h) each Leader has the ability to create multiple Offers listed on the LA, and whilst the tradingstrategy for such multiple offers will be identical, the Performance Fee set for the Offers mayvary. This means that if a CT Client subscribes to two Offers listed on a LA, making identicaltrades, but which have different Performance Fees, such CT Client's net profit from one Offermay be materially different from the other;

(i) Leaders' ultimate purpose, intention and/or financial status may differ from those of CT Clientswho have subscribed to their Offer;

(j) an Event of Default, and how we chose to deal with such Event of Default, may impact copytrading functionalities, trading activity on our CT Platform, and/or LAs or CTAs (for example,CT Client's trades associated with an Offer may be closed out without prior notice);

(k) as outlined in this Schedule, there may be situations in which a trade is not executed. In suchsituations, a CT Client's economic performance, portfolio composition or diversification, riskrating and other factors may deviate from that of the Leader subscribed to; and/or

(l) given the nature of the copy trading functionalities, technological issues may affect a CTClient's execution price and/or results or cause delays in copying resulting in the price of aCT Client's trade to be materially different. Please refer to Clause 32 (Order execution andhandling) and Clause 65 (General exclusion of liability) of our Terms.

4.2. We do not provide any guarantee as to the performance of any particular investment, account, portfolio,Offer, Leader or strategy.

4.3. Past performance, risk ratings, rankings, statistics and any other information including the LeaderInformation are not reliable indicators of future performance. We neither represent nor guarantee that anyCT Client will achieve profits or losses similar to those of the Leader whose Offer such CT Client issubscribed to or has previously subscribed to. We neither represent nor guarantee that the risk rating of aLeader will accurately reflect their future performance or the risk of their future trading activity.

4.4. Please refer to our Terms, including Clause 4 (Risk disclosures) of the Terms, for more information on thekey risks of using our services.



5. Conflicts of interest



5.1. We will endeavour to manage actual and potential conflicts of interest when providing our services. Theremay be situations where your interests conflict with our interests or with another Client's interests.

5.2. We note that a Leader's interests would not be aligned with their CT Clients' in terms of setting the profit-share ratio of Performance Fees.

5.3. Please refer to our Terms, including Section 12 (Conflicts of interest) of the Terms, for more information onconflicts of interest situations.



6. Fees



6.1. Performance Fee



(a) When a CT Client subscribes to an Offer listed on a LA, the associated Performance Feerelated to such Offer is paid to that Leader. Subject to the Terms and this Schedule, suchPerformance Fee will be automatically deducted on a pre -determined frequency set by theLeader who has created the Offer. The Performance Fee is on a profit-share basis, this meansa Performance Fee materialises only in respect of CT Clients trades that are profitable, andthe actual amount of the Performance Fee is dependent on the amount of profit made onsuch CT Client trades (the Performance Fee).
